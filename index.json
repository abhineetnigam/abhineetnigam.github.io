Upon graduation, I will be joining the engineering team at Sundial, an early stage startup working to productise data science as it aligns perfectly with my desire to understand the big picture of the product development cycle.\nI have been fortunate to have various opportunities to explore in my undergrad. With my internships at Google, where I worked on multimodal-information extraction, and at Microsoft Research where I worked on building a logical NLI dataset, I have developed a keen interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I am particularly interested in the aspects of explainability, interpretability and ethics. I am also excited about other emerging technologies like quantum computing and analog computing.
